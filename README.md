# Hastebin

> Create and share the text documents easily!

## _GDSC Dev-a-thon 1.0_

## Objective:

Create a simple tool to share the files and edit, duplicate and share the file with others.

## Tech Stack:

- Node.js
- Express ( For running node **server**)
- MongoDB (Database for storing documents)
- Ejs (For designing **client side**)

## How to run:

- Download .zip file
- Unzip the file
- Open the root folder in the vs code or any ide of your choice
- Open terminal in this folder and write command
  ```jsx
  npm i
  npm start
  ```
- Now open the web browser of your choice, like Google chrome, Firefox or any other.
- Copy paste this URL: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/627a77bdb01179b69f026f10)
- The application will start running and the database will be connected to your local MongoDB database

## Advantages:

1. Any new document created can be **easily shared** just by copying the URL given in the web browser.
2. Each document will have unique id associated with it.
3. After the document is saved then it’s **duplicate copy** can also be created just by clicking on the `Duplicate button`.

## Other tools:

[Heighligt.js](https://safeweb.norton.com/report/show?url=https://highlightjs.org/&ulang=en)

In the hastebin editor user will be writing simple text, which will be eventually converted to highlighted markdown text.

For this purpose highlight.js is used.
